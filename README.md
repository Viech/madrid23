# Semidefinite Programming for Quantum Information Science

Course material for a workshop held in the [Advanced School on Optimization
Methods in Quantum Information](https://www.icmat.es/RT/2023/QIT/week1.php),
part of the ICMAT research term [Quantum Information Theory
2023](https://www.icmat.es/RT/2023/QIT/), that takes place from 27 February to
03 March 2023 at [ICMAT](https://www.icmat.es/) in Madrid, Spain.

## Getting started

[![Open in Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gl/picos-api%2Fmadrid23/HEAD)

The notebooks require a Jupyter Notebook server or notebook-capable code editor,
Python 3.4 or later and the libraries listed in
[requirements.txt](requirements.txt) (which can be installed through the first
notebook). You can click the button above to solve the exercises in your browser
on Binder, though a local setup is recommended.

## Topics

### Notebook 1: First steps with PICOS

A gentle introduction to picos-api/picos>: solve a constrained linear regression
problem.

### Notebook 2: Semidefinite relaxations

Recover a famous SDP-based approximation algorithm for the NP-hard Max-Cut
problem.

### Notebook 3: Truss topology design

Learn about the Schur complement and build a crane.

### Notebook 4: Complex semidefinite programming

Use Hermitian semidefinite programming to calculate bounds for the quantum
channel discrimination problem.
